# SQL_Game_Sales_Project
This project delves into the world of video games, where we analyze best-selling titles spanning from 1977 to 2020. 
By combining sales data with critical and user reviews, we aim to gain insights into the evolution of the gaming industry 
and the impact on the quality of games over the years.
